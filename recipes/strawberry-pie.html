    <h2>Amazing Strawberry Pie Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        This strawberry pie is my favorite pie, and it's very easy to make. I got the recipe <br> 
        many years ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>
        <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a <br> medium saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, <br> stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling <br> strawberry mixture. Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, <br> at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve each slice of pie with <br> a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
